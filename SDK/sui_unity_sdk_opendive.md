## Description

The OpenDive Sui Unity SDK is the first fully-featured Unity SDK with offline transaction building.

This means that games built with our SDK can directly craft custom Move calls without relying Sui's "unsafe" RPC calls under the [Transaction Builder API](https://docs.sui.io/sui-api-ref#transaction-builder-api) -- which in turn reduces the number of RPC / Network requests.
