## Description

Space and Time (SxT) is the verifiable compute layer that scales zero-knowledge proofs on a decentralized data warehouse to deliver trustless data processing to smart contracts, LLMs, and enterprises. Space and Time joins indexed blockchain data from major chains with offchain datasets. Proof of SQL, the novel ZK-proof developed by Space and Time, ensures tamperproof computations at scale and proves that query results haven’t been manipulated. Space and Time is trusted by the most prominent financial institutions, enterprises, and Web3 apps.
